  * Arming check request.
  *
  * Broadcast message to request arming checks be reported by all registered components, such as external ROS 2 navigation modes.
  * All registered components should respond with an ArmingCheckReply message that indicates their current mode requirements, and any arming failure information.
  * The request is sent regularly, even while armed, so that the FMU always knows the current arming state for external modes, and can forward it to ground stations.
  *
  * The reply will include the published request_id, allowing correlation of all arming check information for a particular request.
  * The reply will also include the registration_id for each external component, provided to it during the registration process (RegisterExtComponentReply).
